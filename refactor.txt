The following cards have had their implementation moved from the switch 
statement to their own function:
great hall
mine
remodel
baron
embargo

The following errors have been introduced
in zzzgreathallcardplay()
   num actions changed to +2, should be +1
in zzzminecardplay()
   changed function so players can buy up to 4 more than trashed treasure, 
   should be 3
in zzzremodelcardplay()
   loop to find and discard trashed card starts at 1, not 0
in zzzbaroncardplay()
   incremented estates rather than decrement
in zzzembargocardplay()
   set call to discardCard so it won't trash
